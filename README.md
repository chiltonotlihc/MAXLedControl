MAXLedControl
=============

A python library for controlling the MAX7221 and MAX7219 LED drivers with the RaspberryPi. 
A port of the Arduino LedControl library.

This library is in its very early stages and is not ready for general use. It requires the use of the RPi.GPIO
python library which requires root permissions.
The plan is to incorporate the wonderful WiringPi library.

Hope it is of use to someone.
